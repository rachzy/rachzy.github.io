    content: `My first contact with lines of code came in 2018, when I tried to develop my own Roblox games using
    Lua Script and Minecraft plugins using Java. Even though I didn't go too far on it in that time, my passion
    for coding was born there. Some years later, in 2020, I started on Web-Developing and I created my first project:
    Patrocitizens (Unfinished), which was supposed to be a social media for my city. I made it on PHP only.
    In the end of 2020, I started the development of a project called Fastalk, which was a fast-chat with rooms.
    I made it with PHP and some JavaScript in some parts. After ending that project, I started another one some 
    months later with my friend, called OnCoffee, that I'm currently developing using ReactJS and NodeJS.`,
